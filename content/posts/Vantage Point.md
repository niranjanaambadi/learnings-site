##Review
"Where's the brush?" asks my boy as he quips eager to start revealing dinosaurs on his water painting book. As I took a pause to cater, I couldn't but help but reflect on the overarching theme of 2025 in my life-PAUSE.
While the tech world around has been transfiguring with fancier LLMs, faster inference, frontier AI apps and use cases, for me 2025 has been a year of pause- of beauty, togetherness, hobbies, babies and books.
Strangely so, my present vantage point grants a panoramic view of all that is important, in a blissful coming-of-age state of mind. 

##Lean In
Most people might arguably feel a severe cognitive dissonance with the fast pace of evolving tech world and job landscape. As righteous this feeling is, as important it is to be **leaning in** on the unknown- 
on the unease of the accepting the unfamiliar. Every new wave of human evolution has challenged us with dismantling the mental barriers formed by what feels familiar. The upsurge of AI is certainly no different. 
The smart strategy for us is to acknowledge this and lean in to acceptance. Look at how a child builds a block castle-as tall as it can get, but wrecks it in a jiffy- all in good cheer, only to build a fresh one 
again. Yes, humanity's mental model today is no different. So go and get hold of your inner child.

##Joy
Women in the tech world often see their feminine side relegated to the background.   
Parenthood opens up a whole new dimension of living. I would say that thriving motherhood is all about grounding into your feminine self. A space where beauty, life, kindness, patience and joy takes precedence over competence,
knowledge or independence. Of course, this requires the strong anchor of a masculine presence, tempered by the warmth of friends and family. Given that, it is all about rediscovering beauty in the mundane, healing 
all of your soul with unbridled love and uncensored joy. To *pause* and be receptive to all of that has been the greatest gift.

##Value
This vantage point puts a spotlight on one essential question for the times ahead. How do you add value? Last week, one of the AI forefathers-Yoshua Bengio, has opined that it would only be a matter of time before even service jobs
like plumbing wold be taken over by AI. Humanity is facing change like never before. We are witnessing core skills and years of practice being turned into a joke by LLMs, agents and agentic AI. 

I would say that the true value lies in your _raw self_. While this may be obscured by the familiar's well-worn barricades, it is not impossible to realize if you pause and ponder. 
A new life, human connections, the taste of good food, dance and enriching music- everything original that is vital for a human being **to thrive** and not just live.  

My personal journey of kaizen is underway. And I hope that this site would add some value to yours as well.
